# Using LibrAIry

1. Open the portal. It goes straight to the dashboard; setting a password is optional (Settings -> Portal Security).
2. Drop files or folders into the inbox host path. Nothing to press — the
   worker notices within a couple of seconds.
3. Watch the activity pill in the header, on any page, for what it is doing.
4. Open Review, approve/edit/reject/postpone proposals.
5. Open Commit, create a plan, inspect it, then execute.
6. Use Search and Browse to find indexed files.
7. Use History to inspect or undo committed filesystem operations.

LibrAIry never commits automatically. Analysis only writes database proposals. File moves happen only through an approved immutable plan.

## Knowing something is happening

LibrAIry watches the inbox for you. The worker polls a cheap fingerprint of the
inbox's folder timestamps every couple of seconds while idle, so a file you just
dropped in is picked up almost immediately rather than waiting out the idle
backoff. There is no filesystem-watcher dependency and nothing to configure.

The header carries a small activity pill on every page:

| What you see | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| *nothing* | Idle, and no backlog. The pill takes up no room until it has something to say. |
| *scanning the inbox — 5 to go* | Working, with 5 inbox files found but not yet identified. |
| *identifying files — 12 to go* | Running classification, including any AI step. |
| *7 new files found* | Files are queued and the next cycle will take them. |
| *worker stopped — 7 files waiting, nothing running* | There is a backlog and no heartbeat for three minutes. Check the container logs. |

The pill refreshes itself every three seconds and costs two indexed counts, so
leaving tabs open is cheap.

## Duplicates

Exact duplicates are staged for reversible quarantine review. Similar media flags are informational and require human judgment. LibrAIry never deletes duplicate files.

## Accessing Files

Use the Access page for SMB/FTP/WebDAV pointers. LibrAIry does not serve those protocols; your NAS or operating system does.
